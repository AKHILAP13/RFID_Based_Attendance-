# RFID_Based_Attendance-
A simple RFID Based Attendance system using UART. In  Main_RFID.c just replace the given names with your Usernames and replace the IDs with the ones available in the RFID Reader Card and all set! The output can be seen on both UART Terminal Window &amp; on a 4-Bit Alphanumeric LCD Display. This Project was done on the ARM-Based LPC2129 Microcontroller.
